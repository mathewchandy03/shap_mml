questions for 8/26:
- Unsure what proofs I had to do for Global LOCO
- For each modality, Shapley value is a univariate summary of a single observed sample
- I was also unsure of how to use both sobol indices simultaneously
- The best idea I had was to use the smaller sobol index
when we especially want a smaller model
and the larger one when we especially want
a larger model



tasks for 8/18:
- read https://artowen.su.domains/reports/sobolshapley.pd
- figure out how to include Shapley value into
lei loco approach look at proofs
- write out proof in slide


tasks for 8/23:
- where to go from coverage probabilities of sobol index
to shapley value
- I think sobol index method and conformal inference
must be separate because sobol index requires all samples
- also shapley value must be monotone to use
sobol approach, then cannot use 0 in interval tactic


questions for 8/18:
- seems more useful for inference
about shapley values
- but i'm struggling with model selection
- I was thinking using the mean Shapley value
over the data and then some uncertainty
measure as a tie-breaker, but I don't think
that works because such a tie would never happen
because the Shapley value may be continuous

tasks for 8/14:
- p-value approach doesn't work
- need to think of something else
- maybe standard error estimate from sample,
- Then create rejection region
- maybe use d from paper then center around 0
- do we want negative or positive shapley values?

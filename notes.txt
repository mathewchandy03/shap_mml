tasks for 8/27:
- rigorous proof for basic split conformal with shapley value
- read conformal prediction beyond exchangeability
- focus on shapley value
- write down proofs based on computation of shapley value
and integrate it with conformal
- specify required assumptions for validity of conformal,
try to argue if each assumption is valid
- run simulation to demonstrate how to compute
- jmlr 
- do synthetic data with regression
- confidence interval for attribution for each modality
- put proofs in main.tex
- summarize algorithm in section





questions for 8/26:
- Unsure what proofs I had to do for Global LOCO
- For each modality, Shapley value is a univariate summary of a single observed sample
- I was also unsure of how to use both sobol indices simultaneously
- The best idea I had was to use the smaller sobol index
when we especially want a smaller model
and the larger one when we especially want
a larger model



tasks for 8/18:
- read https://artowen.su.domains/reports/sobolshapley.pd
- figure out how to include Shapley value into
lei loco approach look at proofs
- write out proof in slide


tasks for 8/23:
- where to go from coverage probabilities of sobol index
to shapley value
- I think sobol index method and conformal inference
must be separate because sobol index requires all samples
- also shapley value must be monotone to use
sobol approach, then cannot use 0 in interval tactic


questions for 8/18:
- seems more useful for inference
about shapley values
- but i'm struggling with model selection
- I was thinking using the mean Shapley value
over the data and then some uncertainty
measure as a tie-breaker, but I don't think
that works because such a tie would never happen
because the Shapley value may be continuous

tasks for 8/14:
- p-value approach doesn't work
- need to think of something else
- maybe standard error estimate from sample,
- Then create rejection region
- maybe use d from paper then center around 0
- do we want negative or positive shapley values?

tasks for 8/12:
- read papers I haven't
- read sections 5 and 6 of he jmlr
- understand algorithm implementation and 
change it for uncertainty quantification

tasks for 8/8:
- read Distribution-Free
Predictive Inference for Regression.
- Method for modality selection
based on uncertainty quantification of
shapley values that is computationally
efficient
- refer to he jmlr paper
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00212
- https://academic.oup.com/jrsssb/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jrsssb/qkaf008/8058684


tasks for 8/5:
- write out algorithm, and show two approaches, second one uses information gain

tasks for 8/3:
- clarify what to do with explainer and algorithm to obtain explainer
- maybe clean up math for shapley value a little bit


tasks for 7/25:
- Shapley value for hallucinations
- simulation shapley value for different values of r
- figure out from papers 
- value function may not be known
- prepare slides to talk about different algorithms
for shapley value calculation
- explain pros / cons of each
- formulate general setting for multi modal

tasks for 7/11:
- finish r = 2
- start r > 3
- read recent literature
- shapley value of covariates and interaction terms
